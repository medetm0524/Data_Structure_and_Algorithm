Task 0.
Worst case Big-O is O(1) because run time does not depend of input size.

Taks 1.
Worst case Big-O is O(n) because we have only one for loop.

Task 2.
Worst case Big-O is O(n^2) because there is 2 for loop.

Task 3.
Worst case Big-O is O(nlogn) because there is one for loop and sorting algorithm.

Taks 4.
Worst case Big-O is O(nlogn) because we have one for loop and sorting algorithm.
